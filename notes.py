ðŸ’¡ Hosting Private LLMs on VPS: A Practical Note

For teams experimenting with self-hosted LLMsâ€”especially quantized models like Mistral or LLaMA 2â€”I've found VPS setups to be a solid middle ground between full cloud infra and local prototyping.

Recently tested VPS for a private LLM deployment project. Some Straightforward findings: 
Root access + clean Ubuntu environments made setup straightforward
Enough RAM/CPU for running smaller models with acceptable latency
Decent performance for non-GPU inference via PyTorch + Hugging Face
Good fit for internal tools, prototypes, or private endpoints
Obviously, itâ€™s not for training or heavy inferenceâ€”but for controlled, cost-efficient deployments, it does the job well.

Sometimes all you need is a stable box, SSH, and full control.
